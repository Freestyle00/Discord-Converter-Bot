# Discord-Converter-Bot
This is a Discord bot for converting stuff from American to World measurments and back

# Dependencies
My goal was to make as less pip dependencies as possible so all you need to do is

```bash
pip install discord.py
```
and 
```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```
but this is not really neccesary as this is for me so that the bot tokens will not be publically visible
